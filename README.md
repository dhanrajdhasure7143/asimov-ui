# asimov-ui
Prerequisites:

Before you can run this Angular project, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

Node.js

Version: 14.16.7 (LTS recommended)
Download and install Node.js from the official website.

Angular CLI

Version: 13.2.5
Installation: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
npm install -g @angular/cli@13.2.5

After cloning an Angular project from a remote repository (such as GitHub) to your local machine, follow these steps to set up the project and run it locally:

Step 1: Navigate to the Project Directory

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the Angular project. You can use the cd command to change directories.

Example:


cd /path/to/your/cloned/project
 

Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once you are in the project directory, you need to install the project's dependencies, which are defined in the package.json file. Use the following command to install the required packages:


npm install
 

This command will download and install all the necessary dependencies specified in the package.json file.

Step 3: Run the Angular Application

After installing the dependencies, you can start the Angular development server to run the application. Use the following command:


ng serve
 or 
ng start
  or
set NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192 & ng serve --open
 

This command will compile the application and start the development server. You can access your Angular app by opening a web browser and going to http://localhost:4200. The app will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the code.

Step 4: Access the Angular App

Open a web browser and change the domain  to http://localhost:4200 to see your Angular app in action. You should now be able to interact with the application locally.

That's it! You have successfully cloned the Angular project and set it up on your local machine. You can now start working on the project, making changes, and testing it locally. Happy coding!
